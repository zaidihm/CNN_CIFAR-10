# CNN_CIFAR-10
🖼️ Image Classification with CNN on CIFAR-10

📌 Project Overview
This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using TensorFlow/Keras to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. The dataset consists of 10 classes of objects, such as airplanes, cars, and cats. The model is trained and evaluated with accuracy, loss plots, and classification reports.

🔥 Features
Loads and preprocesses CIFAR-10 dataset
Builds a CNN with multiple convolutional and dense layers
Uses ReLU activation and softmax for classification
Compiles the model with Adam optimizer
Visualizes accuracy and loss trends
Displays predictions on sample images

📊 Dataset Information
CIFAR-10 dataset includes 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes
Each class has 6,000 images
Classes include airplanes, automobiles, birds, cats, deer, dogs, frogs, horses, ships, and trucks

🛠️ Technologies Used
Python
TensorFlow/Keras
Matplotlib
Scikit-learn

📊 Model Performance
Training Accuracy & Loss plotted using Matplotlib
Classification Report summarizing precision, recall, and F1-score
Predicted vs. Actual images for visual evaluation

🔮 Future Enhancements
Implement data augmentation to improve generalization
Experiment with pretrained models (e.g., VGG16, ResNet)
Fine-tune hyperparameters for better accuracy
